## A Study Guide for Navigation Through a Full Stack Development Course

The motivation behind this guide was for my easier understanding of the many topics and lessons that are to be learned throughout a Full Stack Development course. The amount of information is admittedly daunting for such a topic and I wanted to make it less so for myself and anyone else who stumbles upon this project. It solves the problem of easily being able to navigate through the many different topcis of ths subject and to better organize them. As for what I've learned through this process (mainly to be able to laugh at myself for some of the simple mistakes that were made), but also that though there is so very much to learn, it is indeed possible. I'm slowly learning the complex language that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and look forward to being able to look back on this project with awe and happiness at what was the beginning of a wonderful and new career.
