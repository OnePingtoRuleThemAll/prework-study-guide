        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible contenet shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web, this is your foundation.</li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage. They can be text, images, headers and lists. Also used to divide content on a page.</li>
          <li>HTML attributs are ALWAYS defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>Metadata: Data about a webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve a webpage to users, but it is not usually seen by users themselves. It contains info about accessibility, search engines and performance.</li>
          <li>id attribute: used in HTML as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>3 ways to style: Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, External CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>Inline: Used to style and element directly in the HTML file. Useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible.</li>
            <li>Internal SS: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.</li>
            <il>External SS: Most common way to style a webpage. Is preferred in most cases as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</il>
            <li>CSS= STYLE</li>
            <li>Common element types are: meta-related, content division, and semantic.</li>
            <li>charset: character set</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>src attribute: defines the location or source of the image file.</li>
            <li>alt attribute: contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionability of the image.</li>
            <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns: refers to separating code into different files based on use. Based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
            <li>Declarations: contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. (EX: the declaration color:blue; includes the CSS property "color" and the value for that property "blue")</li>
            <li>DRY: Do Not Repeat Yourself: a coding princliple that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of line of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript= INTERACTION</li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in script.</li>
            <li>Every time you do something with a webpage; clicking a button, retrieving data, or filling out a form, JavaScript is at work.</li>
            <li>JavaScript features: variables, strings, data types.</li>
            <li>Invented by Brendan Eich</li>
            <li>Variables: containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the 'let' keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable: let myVariable;</li>
            <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends</li>
            <li>JavaScript IS case sensitive</li>
            <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesing in programming</li>
            <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code</li>
            <li>Operators: Mathematical symbols that produce a result based on two values (or variables)</li>
            <li>An immutable value is one whose content cannoot be changed without creating an entirely new value</li>
            <li>Primitive values are immutable-once a primitave value is created, it cannot be changed, althought the variable that holds it may be reassigned another value.</li>
            <li>Objecs and arrays are mutable by default</li>
            <li>Boolean type: represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false</li>
            <li>BigInt type: a numeric primitive in JS that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
            <li>With BigInts, you can safely story and operate on large integers even beyond hte same integer limit for Numbers</li>
            <li>String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units</li>
            <li>Beware of "stringly-typing" our code!</li>
            <li>Control Flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Computer reads code in a linear fashion, top to bottom</li>
            <li>conditional statements and loops can be used to control the order in which code is executed</li>
            <li>Truthy and Falsy: A value is considered 'falsy' if it is one of the following values:0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN or a Boolean datat type with the value of 'false'. All other values, including Boolean with the value of 'true' are considered 'truthy'</li>
            <li>Array: single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
            <li>Array's are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1</li>
            <li>'for' loop uses the predicatable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <li>A 'for' loop contains the following important statements: the starting point, the condition and the final statement which allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
            <li>Commenting out code: makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later</li>
            <li>Function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
            <li>Code Block=Function Body</li>
            <li></li>

          <ul>
            <li>When doing homework, set a timer for 20 to 30 minutes and work towards solving the problem. Reach out for help if you haven't foudn the solution if you go past the timer</li>
            <li>Have a healthy sense of humor, you're going to need it. :P</li>

        <h2>ON THE JOB</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>ORDER MATTERS: When using headings, it's important to use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. The biggest heading (h1) should only appear once on each page</li>
            <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website</li>
            <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for changes in the browser to seee if the webpage is rendering as expected.</li>
            <li>It is important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub. (This matters especially when working on a team, so that functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members.)</li>
            <li>Working on an outdated version can lead to big sync problems</li>
            <li>In most real-world jobs, when creating a pull request, you would assign other engineers to review your code before merging.</li>
            <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write.</li>
