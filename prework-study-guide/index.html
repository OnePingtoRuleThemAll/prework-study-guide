            <li>Inline: Used to style and element directly in the HTML file. Useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible.</li>
            <li>Internal SS: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.</li>
            <il>External SS: Most common way to style a webpage. Is preferred in most cases as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</il>
            <li>CSS= STYLE</li>
            <li>Common element types are: meta-related, content division, and semantic.</li>
            <li>charset: character set</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>src attribute: defines the location or source of the image file.</li>
            <li>alt attribute: contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionability of the image.</li>
            <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns: refers to separating code into different files based on use. Based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
            <li>Declarations: contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. (EX: the declaration color:blue; includes the CSS property "color" and the value for that property "blue")</li>
            <li>DRY: Do Not Repeat Yourself: a coding princliple that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of line of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

        <h2>ON THE JOB</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>ORDER MATTERS: When using headings, it's important to use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. The biggest heading (h1) should only appear once on each page</li>
            <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website</li>
            <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for changes in the browser to seee if the webpage is rendering as expected.</li>
            <li>It is important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub. (This matters especially when working on a team, so that functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members.)</li>
            <li>Working on an outdated version can lead to big sync problems</li>
            <li>In most real-world jobs, when creating a pull request, you would assign other engineers to review your code before merging.</li>
